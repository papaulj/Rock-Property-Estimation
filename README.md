# Rock-Property-Estimation
Developing an Application to compute select Rock Property from Well Logs
This computer program will enahnce the precision of rock hydrocarbon saturation values computed using Archie formula
Data from well logs, such as porosity, Resitivity Index and Formation factor are inputted into the program
The original version of this program was developed using Python 2
I am trying to master Python 3 and make the program better and more easily understandable
Follow me as I make continuous progress on this work
